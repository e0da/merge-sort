merge-sort.js
=============

Add a stable [merge sort][] method to the JavaScript Array prototype (and jQuery's
`$` and `$.fn`, if available). This is useful because (at the time of this
writing) some popular browsers do not implement a [stable sort][] algorithm in
their JavaScript implementations. A popular application for stable sorting is
sorting tables by multiple columns.

As with JavaScript's own [Array.sort][], you can specify your own comparison
function.

Syntax
------

```javascript
[].mergeSort([compareFunction])
$.mergeSort(list [, compareFunction])
$(selection).mergeSort([compareFunction])
```

### compareFunction

`compareFunction` _(optional)_ is a function that accepts two arguments and returns

 * **-1** if the first argument is **less than** the second
 * **0** if the two arguments are **equal**
 * **1** if the first argument is **greater than** the second

### list

`list` _(required for $.mergeSort() syntax only)_ is a list-like
object which has all of the following properties (like an [Array][]):

1. Has a `length` attribute which contains the number of elements in the list
   (e.g. a list of 5 things has `things.length === 5`)
2. Allows access to its members via zero-indexed bracket notation (e.g.
   `things[3]` refers to the 4th thing in the list)
3. Has a `.slice()` method which behaves identically to [Array.slice][],
   specifically, calling `[a, b, c, d].slice(1)` returns `[b, c, d]`.

Installation
------------

Just include this script before any scripts which would rely on it. If you're
using jQuery, include this script after jQuery and before your application
script.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="merge-sort.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="my-application.js"></script>
```

Examples
--------

### Arrays

I have some arrays of numbers, strings, and miscellany that need sorting.

```javascript
var numbers = [4, 2, 2, 43, 98, 29, 0, 4.3, 9.23],
    strings = ['Porcupine', 'dolphin', 'Squirrel', 'penguin', 'Lion'],
    miscellany = ['23', 89, 'stapler', 4];
```

To sort my numbers, I would just

```javascript
numbers.mergeSort();
// [0, 2, 2, 4, 4.3, 9.23, 29, 43, 98]
```

To sort my strings, I can also just

```javascript
strings.mergeSort();
// ["Lion", "Porcupine", "Squirrel", "dolphin", "penguin"]
```

But with the default comparison, they don't come out alphabetical. The
capitalized words come first. For a case insensitive sort, I need to define a
compare function.

```javascript
strings.mergeSort(function (left, right) {
  left = left.toLowerCase();
  right = right.toLowerCase();

  if (left < right) {
    return -1;
  } else if (left === right) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return 1;
  }
});
// ["dolphin", "Lion", "penguin", "Porcupine", "Squirrel"]
```

That's more like it. How about that last list of miscellany? I want my numbers
first, then my words, but I want strings containing numbers treated as numbers.
Pretty specific, but I can describe it with a function.

```javascript
miscellany.mergeSort(function (left, right) {

  if (isNaN(left) === false) {
    left = parseFloat(left);
  }

  if (isNaN(right) === false) {
    right = parseFloat(right);
  }

  if (typeof left !== typeof right) {
    if (typeof left === 'number') {
      return -1;
    } else {
      return 1;
    }
  } else {
    if (left < right) {
      return -1;
    } else if (left === right) {
      return 0;
    } else {
      return 1;
    }
  }
});
// [4, "23", 89, "stapler"]
```

### jQuery

Used with jQuery, you'll probably always want to supply a compare function, so
I'll only discuss those cases. Here's a non-trivial example. I have a table:

```html
<table id=demo>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>First Name
      <th>Last Name
      <th>Occupation
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Bob
      <td>Durp
      <td>Programmer
    <tr>
      <td>Alice
      <td>Morp
      <td>Programmer
    <tr>
      <td>Luis
      <td>Durp
      <td>Analyst
</table>
```

Which looks something like

    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    + First Name + Last Name + Occupation +
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    | Bob        | Durp      | Programmer |
    ---------------------------------------
    | Alice      | Morp      | Programmer |
    ---------------------------------------
    | Luis       | Durp      | Analyst    |
    ---------------------------------------

I can sort by any column. To sort by Last Name (the 2nd column):

```javascript
 $('#demo tbody').html($('#demo tbody tr').mergeSort(function (left, right) {

  left = $(left).find('td:nth-child(2)').text().toLowerCase();
  right = $(right).find('td:nth-child(2)').text().toLowerCase();

  if (left < right) {
    return -1;
  } else if (left === right) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return 1;
  }
}));
```

And the table will be updated to look like this:

    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    + First Name + Last Name + Occupation +
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    | Bob        | Durp      | Programmer |
    ---------------------------------------
    | Luis       | Durp      | Analyst    |
    ---------------------------------------
    | Alice      | Morp      | Programmer |
    ---------------------------------------

You can see how with a little imagination and the application of a click
handler, this could be extrapolated to allow real-time resorting of a table.
And since it's a stable sort, you can sort by multiple columns sequentially.

### Other

You can apply this merge sort to any other compatible type in the same way (see
_list_ in the Syntax section above for compatibility).

    $.mergeSort(aListOfSomeKind, compareMyListItems);

The `$.mergeSort()` syntax is just [sugar][] for
`Array.prototype.mergeSort.call()`, so the above is equivalent to

    Array.prototype.mergeSort.call(aListOfSomeKind, compareMyListItems);

But just use the simpler `$.mergeSort()` syntax. **:)**
